# Jo√£o Vieira
## Software Developer

  I'm a soon-to-be computer science graduate (expected graduation late 2024) embarking on my coding adventure! During my studies, I had the opportunity to gain practical experience as a Software Engineer intern at Renault solidifing my love for programming and problem-solving, which has fueled my long-held dream of one day creating my own indie game.
  Currently, I'm actively seeking a software engineering position to further develop my skills and contribute to a collaborative team environment, in preparation for the journey, I've been learning and building my technical skillset. Here are some of the languages and tools I've been focusing on:

Skills: JAVA / JAVASCRIPT / TYPESCRIPT / HTML / CSS / SQL / C / C++ / C# / NODE JS / LINUX
